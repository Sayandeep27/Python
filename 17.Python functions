#function = a block of code which is executed only when it is called.

#return statement = Functions send Python values/objects back to the caller.
#                    These values/objects are known as the functionâ€™s return value

# keyword arguments =   arguments preceded by an identifier when we pass #                                           them to a function
#                                           The order of the arguments doesn't matter, unlike  #                                           positional arguments
#                                           Python knows the names of the arguments that     #                                           a function receives

def hello(first,middle,last):
